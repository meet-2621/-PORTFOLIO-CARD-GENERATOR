I created a responsive web application that generates a personalized portfolio card using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project allows users to input their name, role, short bio, profile picture URL, and social media links (LinkedIn and GitHub). As users fill out the form, the preview card updates in real-time, giving instant visual feedback.

This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills, especially in DOM manipulation, Bootstrap layout structuring, form handling, and event-driven JavaScript. It also emphasizes user experience by making it easy to create a clean and professional-looking profile preview in the browser itself.

The application is mobile-friendly and visually polished, thanks to Bootstrap's responsive grid system and utility classes. It reflects my ability to design, build, and style interactive components using only web standards â€” without any frameworks.
